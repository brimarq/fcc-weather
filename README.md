# Show the Local Weather  

Code challenge at FreeCodeCamp:  
https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/show-the-local-weather  

---
Uses browser geolocation and the freeCodeCamp weather API to display local weather conditions with the ability to switch between F and C temperature measurements. Built with Bootstrap 4 and uses FontAwesome for the loading spinner.

NOTE: For some reason, the API doesn't always return the conditions for your current location, even though those are sent (see console). When this happens, the returned location defaults to "Shuzenji, JP" with no icon representing the current weather conditions. If you get this, just try reloading the page until you eventually get your location's weather. Seems like there's an issue with the API... busy, maybe?
